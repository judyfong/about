### Website

Making websites is what I have been doing for over a decade as a freelancer and
as a software developer. I have worked with Wordpress, Drupal, PHP, Bootstrap,
various CMS, and other web development technologies.

#### Responsive Design

One of my main focuses when making a website is making it responsive. This
means your website will work on any device: phone, tablet, or computer. This is
especially important due to web browsers’ and Google’s decision to rank
websites with responsive design higher than non-responsive websites. A
responsive website means, with a large number of web traffic done by mobile
devices today, viewers and potential clients can access your site with ease.

### Information + Data Management

I have also been a data scientist for five years. So I can work with databases,
data files, and things. This means I help create a more organized and well
documented space be it virtual (website) or physical (office or home).
