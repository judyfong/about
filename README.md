# About

Hi! My name is Judy Y. Fong. So, I'm Judy. I really believe in open source, especially in regards to books. Therefore, I have made it my mission to make old books available to a wider reading audience, with a focus on Icelandic books first.

## More about me
I also work on language technology, a.k.a. natural language processing and artificial intelligence (AI) sometimes with a current focus on financial technology to aid me in my bachelor of arts (BA) in Icelandic as a second language studies and thesis, with a minor in Business administration (Íslenska sem annað mál 120 ECTS aðalgrein með aukagrein í viðskiptafræði). I am hoping to finish my hopefully trilingual thesis by December 2024 because I have failed to finish it it in the 2023-2024 school year, a.k.a. the previous two semesters.

Additionally, I have a [blog](https://blog.judyyfong.xyz) where I
talk about various interests. My semi-decent [projects are listed
here](https://projects.judyyfong.xyz). Extremely rough projects can be found on
my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/judyfong). I have written a few [academic
publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dI2DL2oAAAAJ&hl=en) and
given some related [talks](https://projects.judyyfong.xyz/talks). You can read
more about my professional career on my
simple([EN](/concise-resume)|[IS](/is-einfold-ferilskra)) or
[verbose](/tech-resume) resume. In my free time, I have 
[translated a few fictional stories](https://baekur-online.github.io/judy-fong-online/).

indicates which service: e.g. `[Website Services] Let's discuss`.

### Website

Making websites is what I have been doing for over a decade as a freelancer and
as a software developer. I have worked with Wordpress, Drupal, PHP, Bootstrap,
various CMS, and other web development technologies.

[Example websites](https://judyyfong.xyz)

#### Responsive Design

One of my main focuses when making a website is making it responsive. This
means your website will work on any device: phone, tablet, or computer. This is
especially important due to web browsers’ and Google’s decision to rank
websites with responsive design higher than non-responsive websites. A
responsive website means, with a large number of web traffic done by mobile
devices today, viewers and potential clients can access your site with ease.

### Information + Data Management

I have also been a data scientist for five years. So I can work with databases,
data files, and things. This means I help create a more organized and well
documented space be it virtual (website) or physical (office or home).

### Natural Language work

#### Proofreading + Editing

I offer proofreading in English and Icelandic along with copy editing if you are 
also interested in that. My services start at 20,000 ISK per hour.

#### Teaching Icelandic
I teach Icelandic through my online school, [Menntaskólinn í Hamraborg í 
Lautarvík við strönd og woods](https://projects.judyyfong.xyz/Mih/). I also offer 
tutoring at 30,000 ISK an/per hour but if you have services to offer then we can also barter.
